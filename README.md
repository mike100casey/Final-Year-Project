# Developing FYP

With increasing fuel costs, greater awareness of CO2 emissions and traffic congestion through the increasing number of vehicle on the roads. 
The use of carpooling applications has never been more needed. With this application the trips are prearranged, 
which means that the drivers and passengers agree to share a ride in advance, a typical time period is a day or greater.
 Users of the application either post a journey as a registered driver or a request as a registered passenger. 
 The application will match drivers and passengers together based on date, time and location. 
 The solution becomes more difficult when time constraints and route detours are taken into account. 
 If a match is established, the application will notify the participants through the use of email. 
 If the driver and the passenger agree on the proposed price of the ride share, the driver picks up the rider at the agreed time and location.
